# GN-Scraper
google news scraper using html_requests 

i wanted to put something inside of my welcome ai or jjst any bot i made for sys automation 

this script uses requests and html parsign instead of BS4 which is the average python library for news or website scraping, this gives you the following 


header,

text,

link,


if you want you can choose how much scrolldown you want, that is how much the google news page is refreshed you can change this script but you will have to build aroud the headers

best of luck XD
